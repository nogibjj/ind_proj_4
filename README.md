# Local LLM MODEL DEPLOYMENT

## Overview
This repository showcases a powerful text generation model integrated into a FastAPI microservice. The model, based on OpenAI's GPT-2 architecture, excels in generating coherent and context-aware responses. The FastAPI microservice provides a convenient API for interacting with the model in real-time.

## Key Features
Text Generation Model:

GPT-2-based model for natural language generation.
Trained on diverse datasets for versatile responses.

FastAPI Microservice:

Utilizes FastAPI for efficient and fast API development.User-friendly endpoint for generating responses by providing prompts.
